"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."

@LanceUlanoff Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia &amp; other important car terms at https://t.co/CftQ1v9YCL
"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."

"@doctorow I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest &amp; failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"@dimas_______ @Robotbeat @doctorow UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls &amp; far left shills to trash Tesla &amp; me in press &amp; social media. Such creeps."
"@TheSithSeth @doctorow I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."

"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
@PassionPlanet1 @supernovaslight @lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
"@lexiheft @dancow @tedhu @chadgowens @scottwww @JessicaHuseman Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."

Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
@scotch_io That’s why editors are included too
@SophieWarnes We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.

@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
"@plot_qasc It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
@clemyeung Exactly

"@GlobalProTrader @wmiddelkoop True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
"@joshgans We went through the same drama on S &amp; X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"

"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
"@MKBHD @HyperChangeTV The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

"@dlxinorbit @doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
"@doug_ellison @dsfpspacefl1ght The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."
