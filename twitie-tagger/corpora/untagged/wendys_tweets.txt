"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo And you may be thinking this story is just a marketing ploy.

Maybe, but this sandwich will still fill you with joy."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo The Old Lady and Maple Syrup Man fell in
love on that date,

which is why with Wendy‚Äôs Bacon Maple Chicken Sandwiches we celebrate."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo When the townspeople awoke 
they were filled with glee.

Not only syrup, but many a Bacon Maple 
Chicken Sandwich they did see."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo Sandwich satchel in tow, they hopped 
on the Goose

and delivered Maple syrup from 
hoose to hoose."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo Once they arrived in the past, 
they spent the whole day at work

making every person in town 
a Maple Syrup Day perk."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo But to save Maple Syrup Day, there was only one way: 

Taking Dealio‚Äôs time portal 
back by one day."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo And with just one bite, Maple Syrup Man‚Äôs faith was restored.

He was ready to deliver Maple syrup 
once more."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo He didn‚Äôt deserve her kindness, that much is true.

He knew it. She knew it. 
You know it too."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo Motivation he needed, 
at least enough to get dressed. 

So she made him a Bacon Maple Chicken Sandwich she knew would impress."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo When they found Maple Syrup Man, 
he was quite a sore sight.

It had slipped his mind that 
tonight was the night."
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo So the pair continued their quest and came across a wise tree.

‚ÄúUp that hill‚Äù the tree said, ‚Äúlives the man you‚Äôre wanting to see.‚Äù"
"@SWatercolour @sweaterdillo When the lady agreed, 
Dealio asked to come along.

He‚Äôd been longing to hear 
the Maple Goose‚Äôs sweet song."
"@SWatercolour Dealio offered a deal: 
he‚Äôd direct her where to go

if she followed his handmade 
sweater account @sweaterdillo."
"@SWatercolour ‚ÄúI must find Maple Syrup Man!‚Äù said the lady as she set out on her quest.

In the Maple Forest she met Dealio, 
an armadillo wearing a festive sweater vest."
"@SWatercolour When she realized she hadn‚Äôt yet heard Maple Goose‚Äôs sweet howl.

That‚Äôs when the little old lady knew something was afoul."
"@SWatercolour Her Maple Boot‚Ñ¢ had not been filled with syrup, not even a hair.

And the bacon bouquet she left on the mantle was still there."
"@SWatercolour ‚ÄòTwas the night before Maple Syrup Day and all through the house, not a creature was stirring not even a ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù

the old lady wondered, ‚Äúcould the Maple Syrup Man be running late?‚Äù"
And now it's time to enjoy everybody‚Äôs favorite holiday classic. https://t.co/FBNoSVId6Y
