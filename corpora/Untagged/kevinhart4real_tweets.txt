That’s what I like to hear #irresponsibletour https://t.co/ZAM3mPMg1R
I believe in equality and I want it for people of color more than anything. Right is right and wrong is wrong. This matter hit home because it’s where I’m from. My heart goes out to those men that were treated horribly. Shit is truly sad that we are still going  backwards
The last thing that I will say on this matter is..before we jump out the gate with anger sometimes it’s ok to think first...how many people of color are employed by that company? How many families are being taken care of because of the income that’s being provided by said company
I was simply saying not to boycott before seeing what the company was going to do....after watching the interview that the CEO of @Starbucks did on @GMA I feel that they failed in doing what they should have done. Now actions can be taken...
I also felt that the company should of stood up and addressed the matter and made us feel comfortable in understanding that this wrong doing would never happen again...and that they should of addressed the victims with a apology etc
You obviously don’t comprehend well...I asked @Starbucks to make the situation right...I asked them to fix it. I said that the person on duty should of been held accountable. https://t.co/nbJc7KwPDD

This really makes me sad... @Starbucks had a platform and a real opportunity @GMA to fix that situation correctly by calling it exactly what it was which was racial profiling/discrimination by the on duty manager. YOU FAILED ...That person should have been FIRED. https://t.co/inweLlGu4q
I have another pinky toe update people....I had to remove the sole out of my right sneaker because of the swelling. I also called the hotel and ask them to please remove the dresser from my room that did this to me. FML
This is not a joke....my pinky toe is still hurting from yesterday. This is officially a problem. I think I’m walking with a slight limp. This shit hurts like hell #FML

"Which is why I said in my previous tweets ""STARBUCKS"" Please make this right 🤦🏾‍♂️....What are you missing????? https://t.co/BnPjJfoVBl"
@ardeart1 you are the true example of why so many people with platforms choose to just be quiet because you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. Luckily I had some time day and felt like feeding into your high level of ignorance.
"@ardeart1 @Starbucks That's not being a ""Uncle Tom"" @ardeart1 that's being smart....That's being educated in the world of business. That's called being a adult and vetting out a situation properly. You have officially been educated...."
@ardeart1 @Starbucks After apologizing to the people affected by the incident I would assure my costumers that it would never happen again and make sure they were aware that the situation was handled correctly.
@ardeart1 @Starbucks People are so quick to jump on a anger train without thinking....I am now a CEO so excuse me for thinking like one...If somebody that works for me messes up its my job as the head of my company to fix it by handling that INDIVIDUAL. I would have to let the person go
I will address your ignorance professionally...I have no obligation or relationship with @Starbucks 1st and foremost. @hm problem came from the top which gave reason for the reaction to that situation. This problem comes from a bad hire. The person was wrong not the brand. https://t.co/kSA0wCgss4

Let's make one thing very clear....This is not a boycott @Starbucks situation....This is horrible management. The manager on duty was wrong. It's that simple...That's who needs to take responsibility for this wrong doing.
#IrresponsibleTour https://t.co/jWcWXcK9gT
@Starbucks in Philadelphia I have watched the video and do not see these to young men doing anything wrong....Unless there is footage that shows otherwise you need to do what's right and handle the manager that was on duty accordingly.
Message to the @Starbucks in Philadelphia....Our city is shining bright like a diamond right now. Please make this situation right. I repeat please make this situation right!!!!!!! Once again MAKE THIS RIGHT
