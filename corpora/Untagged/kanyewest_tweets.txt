Bob Dylan
"If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I would’ve let it slide
If I’d lived my life by what others were thinkin’, the heart inside me would’ve died
I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the risin’ star, Its up to me"
Met with Trav at my crib this morning   We expressed ourselves    It’s all love
https://t.co/f0QyccE0T6
I will put this in question form     Who has heard of the twelve lost tribes of Judah?  Have you heard that two of the tribes were actually black? 🤔
WE FREE
We free
I love that we are destigmitizing mental health     Gucciman and Quavo have a song Bipolar this is so good for culture
I’m loving the new music I’ve been working on. 6 months off meds I can feel me again.   Remember when dark fantasy came out I used to tweet a storm also.
RT @CranetheGod: love you ye 💜🙏🏼 blessings https://t.co/4rPBWCCsNr
Keep squares out yo circle
There was a handler with me at TMZ a so called voice of reason that thank the lord no longer is in my circle
I have no more handlers     Only fear god
RT @CranetheGod: STOP SAYING THAT KIM NEEDS TO TAKE YE PHONE OR HE NEEDS TO TAKE HIS MEDS THIS IS RAW EMOTION YALL DO NOT FEEL THAT ANYMORE…
I give up drinking every week
You don’t make runaway on medication      Even alcohol is and addictive substance called spirits that actually block our earthly connection to our spirit when we drown ourselves in it
I cannot be on meds and make watch the throne level or dark fantasy level music
God has given me this voice for a reason
Perhaps we stop looking at my tweets as rants and start looking at them as therapy testimonials and some even ministry
Man makes plans and god laughs
I need to speak about how Chance demanding that we record in Chicago reconnected me with my roots and also my faith in Jesus Christ
You have to see and feel how happy I am and how strong my family is. We are even stronger because of this through the love and grace of god
People said my career was over after TMZ       I need to show the world that we so called crazy people will not be just written off
I’ve been trying to do a serious interview speaking on mental health but it seems as though all members of press are afraid to speak to someone who has been diagnosed but is still everyone’s favorite super hero
"RT @JaidaRaymond: Thank u for being you, goat @kanyewest 💜💜💜"
People try to ‘handle you when they think you have a mental problem
RT @colinags: don't be coming on here trying to police Kanye and tell him what to do and talk to him like people dealing with mental health…
We as a society are taking control of our consciousness and raising it together
The paradigm is shifting
We love
Drake and Trav both love Ye more than anyone and I love those guys back. We love everyone
We’re all growing together
It’s like when you see a tv show from the 60s and it’s super racist and sexist
It reminds me of when I said stop hip hop homophobia      It used to be ok for rappers to bash gay people just listen to certain rap records from the 90s and early 2000s
I don’t blame people for not knowing how to handle this that said we as a society will learn together
I am able to experience first hand how people who have mental health issues get written off by society.    Don’t listen to him cause he’s crazy. He’s washed cause he’s crazy etc...
No one would ever choose to end up in a mental hospital and diagnosed with a mental disorder but god chose me to publicly go through this journey and it is beautiful
Drake verbally attacked Cudi when he was in the hospital and went at me after TMZ because I decided to release albums in June   Is snowballed and he refused to meet with me but texted my mother in law and did sneak disses on peoples records that I consider family
People will no longer take mental health for a joke

I’ve made mistakes and have karma   No man is perfect     The universe will test us
I’m a man about my family and integrity
Broke down doors for sneakers fashion music everything
No artist should ever diss me for clout   Period
I need that love and respect that we didn’t give Michael while I’m alive
If I wasn’t here all artist would do memorial songs
If I wasn’t hear all artist would be doing memorial songs
I actually like sickomode but I don’t like that that is was sneak disses
Love to all artist
I love everybody all positive energy    No one that is a musician should ever diss me     My existence is for the rights of all artist
All positive energy   I got love for everyone     Just don’t sneak diss or diss at all    I paid the dues for all weirdos
I have a problem with sneak disssing
I hit Trav earlier today    Now he just hit me    More threats
Drake called me threatening me
It’s not about rap     It’s about family   We have to be close as a family and never let these people infiltrate just for radio spins
Family first
Fuck clout
Fuck that sickomode song        Family first and always
It’s what I felt   And have been feeling for awhile   All positive   All love
Perhaps I should have been more like water today
All positive energy
We should all be on this planet working together
https://t.co/kdorJkJJqE
Trying to kick me while I’m down
Our brother is lost and confused
If Drake would go at Ye that there is interviews that he loves me then he doesn’t give a fuck about anyone
You tried to hurt my pockets
You threatened the safety of me and my family
Noooooo moooooore fake playing with peoples lives kids and mental health
Noooooooo moooooore cap
He passes Drakes the crib everyday
To the right    It’s   On sight     Saint stays to the right
This clout shit done got outta hand bro
Trav is my family and let this met throw sneak disses at me for clout
I heard Drake had more bars dissing me that were removed
I used to bring Travis with me everywhere with me    Im an inspiration to both him and Drake
Only positive energy
I will never put negative energy into a song
I will never make a diss record
You’re mad at me for something I didn’t do
I would never mention your (blank)
I’m Ye bro    Remember that   I love you   I would never intentionally hurt you     That’s what I’ve been saying to you
This year has been really tough and you have added to the confusion
Leave me and my family alone bro
But you’re playing into it    Why?   A false runner???  A beat???
You would be so sad if anything ever happened to me
Drake this is what they want
This is a man speaking to a man that has been placed in the program to fuck with Kanye West head and set me up
These tweets are not emotional
To the right it’s on sight    Saint stays to the right bro
Never threaten north saint and Chicago’s dad bro
Never threatened north and saint and Chicago’s daddy bro
Trust god bro    God sees all    Stop the act     Cut the program
Fear no man
Nobody scared of anything but god
Nobody scared of anything but gods
Nobody scared of anything
Some true artist are a bit crazy   Everybody is not Programed
It’s not just you the world stigmatizes is and calls us crazy
You are disrespectful to all people with mental health conditions so this is an opportunity for growth
Trust God
God sees all
Please take the devil 👿 up out you bro
We’re making the world better at all times
This is for no ones entertainment
Or the Mandingo part on Jango
Drake I’m not going to physically fight you like it’s MTV boxing
How you gone be on Trav’s song coming at me. Trav should have never allowed that
How you gone text Kriss but not speak to me
We need to show the world that we will speak without someone ending up dead or in jail
We need to show people we can talk without people ending up dead or in jail
We need to show the world that people can talk without someone ending up dead or in jail
I’m up for talking.  We need to show all of these fans that black men can@talk without someone ending up dead or in jail
Ye never been easy.  I navigated these waters before you.  That’s why you could be you
You try to pick targets you think are easy
Talk tough to real gangsters bro
You say all this shut to me but won’t say none of that to J prince
You send emojis
Bro stop
You get people hurt at concerts
You pick@on people with mental health issues
You trying to be a bully. I never been bullied in my life and I never will be.  That’s why I made it this far in a pink polo
We both too high profile for you to actually do something to me
Snoop is my elder and an inspiration to me
There would never be a drake without a Kanye west so never come out your mouth with a threat
If I’m bipolar      This kind of shit can get me ramped
Stop the act
Now it’s a kid in@critical condition
Cause we rather act cool than sit and have a convo
That’s why black people never get ahead and and we stay controlled
You wouldn’t send purple emojis to scooter but you wanna need with your brother
I’m your oxygen
Don’t ever speak on 350s
Now he’s so street
I’m the guy with the pink polo that made a way for him
When I go through shit he fucks with me and I’m his idol
When Cudi was in the hospital he sent shots
He be texting people I know like it’s cool     But won’t sit and talk with me
He running around like he pac
Everybody knows somebody
I got a family and kids. 69 is locked up xxx is dead.  The kid that ran on stage is in the hospital
It just doesn’t sit right on my spirit
So drake if anything happens to me or anyone from my family you are the first suspect    So cut the tough talk
Since the pool line he’s been trying to poke at me and fuck with me
The kid he had run on stage at Pushas concert is in critical condition
Drake called trying to  threatened me

No tough talk either
I would never intentionally try to hurt you bro     I never even heard none of the diss records      That ain’t my MO  never did a diss record
Sending purple emojis   When I’m dealing with mental shit      I need my apologies now      Not through scooter either     Not through Travis
It’s all love bro bro but don’t play with me.  You stay too close to be playing all these industry games bro
I told you I ain’t tell Pusha about your son
Been trying to meet with you for 6 months bro       You sneak dissing on trav records and texting Kris talking bout how’s the family

I understand Pusha’s issues as a man if someone mentions your fiancé men go mask off. I’ve done the same myself at times. I love you and I love Pusha and we all have an admiration for each other’s craft.
I did not have any conversations about your child with Pusha. I don’t play with the idea of people’s children after I spoke to Wiz a few years earlier.
I never listened to either diss track that followed but I did hear quotes from both songs after they were released
since we were building as friends and brothers I should have spoken to Pusha about the Quentin Miller bar. There should have been no songs with my involvement that had any negative energy towards you

The question was so important I took time to think. And then I was hit with the let’s go to commercial break. That interview showed strong personalities with different opinions having a civil conversation.

it's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma
"Instead of doing what you feel 
you just do what other people think you should do"
Your conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people’s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now
try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.
the concept of loving people has a stigma

with love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.
And also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.

I love Hillary too."
You don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.

there's been a lot of fake news so I just wanted to give you the facts. Yeezy will become the biggest apparel company in human history by working with the most genius level talents and creating product at an affordable price. I hired the head of supply chain from the Gap.
I am currently the single highest paid person in footwear. That means I make more money on shoes than Michael Jordan.
We have 160 positions to fill by the end of the year. Yeezy will hit a billion dollars this year. It is the 2nd fastest growing company in history. It is a unicorn on its way to becoming a decacorn.
yes I got rid of my last lawyer why? Because he wouldn't come to work full time. I also asked my last manager to come work full time for Yeezy of course the last lawyer and manager said no. So now I hired a CEO and a CFO and i have two full time lawyers as of now.

self victimization is a disease
there was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.

We live in a time where people don’t respect people for being themselves
Constantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there

There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.
Be here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see.
me and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.
"I will work on this ""book"" when I feel it. When We sit still in the mornings We get hit with so many ideas and so many things We want to express. When I read this tweet to myself I didn't like how much I used the word I so I changed the I's to We's."
oh by the way this is my book that I'm writing in real time. No publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write. This is not a financial opportunity this is an innate need to be expressive.
"everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to ""the simulation"".  Parents are our first acting coaches."
"in life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner"
just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.
You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness.
I don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you.
Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.
You have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can.
when you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.
trend is always late
be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.
Fear often causes people to be manipulative
everything you do in life stems from either fear or love
Sometimes you have to get rid of everything
distraction is the enemy of vision
try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas
You have to protect your ability to create at all cost
As a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency
often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and  friends
Some people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness
