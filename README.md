This program will utilize various POS tagging and tokenizing methods to parse Twitter corpuses and generate random Tweets, eventually leading to an ecosystem of multiple Twitter bots tweeting with each other.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Twitter is a form of mass media in which a lot of people can express their feelings about many topics on this platform. By analyzing certain celebrity tweets about certain topics, we can predict what people will say about certain topics. Hopefully, this can be expanded to demonstrate future topics of conversation about a subject before they come up.

## Instructions 

$ ./pos_tagger.sh <training corpus> <output file>

#### Example

$ ./pos_tagger.sh corpora/ritter_dev.nolabels output_pos.txt
